	<h2>World's Best Lasagna Recipe</h2>

	<p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.</p>

	<p>Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me his favorite recipe for lasagna which he has been cooking since his college days. Alton's original recipe created enough lasagna for a small army so I halved it. What is posted here will easily serve eight people.</p>

		<li>1/2 pound dry lasagna noodles (requires 9 lasagna noodles - unbroken)</li>
		<li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
		<li>1 1/2 pounds (24 ounces) mozzarella cheese, grated or sliced</li>
		<li>1/4 pound (4 ounces) freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
		<li>Salt</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Steps</h3>

	<ol>
		<li>Put pasta water on to boil</li>
		<li>Brown the ground beef</li>
		<li>Cook the bell pepper, onions, garlic, add back the beef</li>
		<li>Transfer to medium sized pot, add tomatoes and remaining sauce ingredients to build the sauce</li>
		<li>Boil and drain the lasagna noodles</li>
	</ol>
